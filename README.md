<h4 align="center">An Asteroids inspired roguelite written entirely from scratch in C with the help of SDL3!</h4>
  
This was my first adventure into both C programming and writing a game without an engine; I learned a lot of lessons along the way and ultimately had a good time doing it. I definitely took for granted the 'simple' things modern engines do, like text rendering or audio management, and so implementing those systems were challenging but also rewarding.
